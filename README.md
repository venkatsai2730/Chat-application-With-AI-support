# Project Title  
A simple Express.js API to send a greeting message  

---

## Description  
This project provides a basic server that responds with a "Hello World!" message when accessed via HTTP. The application uses Node.js and Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.  

---

### Features  
1. **RESTful API**: Supports GET request to `/` endpoint.  
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: Ensures user input is properly sanitized.  
3. **Error Handling**: Basic error messages for invalid paths.  
4. **Lightweight Dependency**: Uses only essential modules (`express`, `path`, `http`), no heavy libraries.  

---

### Prerequisites  
To run this project locally, you need:  
- Node.js installed on your system (>= v12.13.3).  
- Git if you plan to contribute or fork the repository.  

---

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository using HTTPS:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/userrepo/api-greeting.git  
2. Navigate into the directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd api-greeting  
3. Install dependencies:

### Usage  

#### Example 1: Run the Server  
Run the following command in your terminal:  
```bash  
npm start  
```  
This will start the server on port `3000`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the output:  
"Hello World!"  

#### Example 2: Send a POST Request  
You can also interact with the API using cURL:  
```bash  
curl -d '{"name":"John"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/greet  
```  
Replace `"John"` with your own name. This sends a POST request to `/api/greet`, which processes the JSON body and returns a personalized response. For example, it might return:  
```json  
{  
  "status": "success",  
  "message": "Hello John!"  
}  
```
